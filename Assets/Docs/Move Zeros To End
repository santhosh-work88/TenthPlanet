You are given an array arr[] of non-negative integers. Your task is to move all the zeros in the array to the right end while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements. The operation must be performed in place, meaning you should not use extra space for another array.

{
for(int i = 0; i<arr.length;i++){
	if
}


[1,0,3,0,0,5,4]
[1,3,0,0,5,4,0]
[1,3,0,5,4,0,0]
[1,3,5,4,0,0,0]
